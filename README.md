# Problems-of-java.
Welcome to the Java Problem Solutions repository! üéâ

This repository is a collection of Java coding challenges, complete with well-documented solutions to help you build and test your Java programming skills. Each problem includes a description, solution approach, and sample code. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for coding interviews, working on problem-solving skills, or just practicing Java, this repo has something for everyone!

üìù Problem Categories
You'll find solutions to a variety of Java problems, organized by topic:

* Arrays & Matrices: Manipulating arrays, working with multidimensional arrays, summing boundaries, and diagonals.

* Strings: Palindrome checking, string manipulations, character counting, and formatting.

* Loops & Conditions: Implementing loops, conditional checks, and handling complex conditions.

* Data Structures: Linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees.

* Algorithms: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and recursion.

* Math Problems: Calculations, prime numbers, factorials, and mathematical patterns.

Each problem includes an explanation of the approach, complexity analysis, and a clean Java solution, so you can understand the reasoning behind each answer.
